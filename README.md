# Flutter-License
TCS humAIn
This is a Flutter application that is used to locate the `license plate` out of a picture given to the application.<br>
**Cue the Drum Rolls** for what I am about to disclose.<br>
With the help of [Sayak Paul](https://github.com/sayakpaul) the tensorflow model that was 255mb was cut short to a `2mb` file.<br>
TFLite did the trick for us.<br>
The application is an offline application, that can do a pretty niffty job at license plate location.<br>
